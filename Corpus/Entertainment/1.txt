Robert Pattinson's moody superhero adventure The Batman prevailed Pattinson at the box office again.

The film earned $66 million in its second weekend of release, propelling its domestic tally to a robust $238.5 million. After only 10 days on the big screen, The Batman ranks as the highest-grossing movie of 2022, as well as the second-highest grossing movie since the onset of COVID-19.
